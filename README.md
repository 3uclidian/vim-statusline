# My custom statusline
Pretty similar to lightline, just wanted to see if I could implement it myself

# Usage
Make sure vim was compiled with Lua support.

Clone the repo into a directory that matches either
`~/.vim/pack/*/opt/`
or `~/.vim/pack/*/start/`.
(If you cloned it into the `opt` directory put the following into your .vimrc)
`packadd! statusline`
